# HOTEL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

## Problem Statement:
In the hospitality industry, hotels face challenges in managing guest services efficiently due to disconnected processes and manual management of reservations, check-ins, billing, and housekeeping. This fragmented approach often results in booking errors, inconsistent billing, and delayed services, leading to customer dissatisfaction and operational inefficiencies. A comprehensive, centralized Hotel Management System (HMS) is needed to streamline operations, reduce human errors, and improve guest experience by automating bookings, room assignments, billing, and resource management, while providing real-time insights to support data-driven decisions for hotel management.

## Objectives
- Automate and Centralize Booking Management
- Enhance Guest Experience
- Optimize Resource Management
- Enable Data-Driven Decision-Making

## Main Entities
- Guests

## Expected outcomes of the database solution
- Seamless and error-free bookings
- Enhanced operational efficiency
- Consistent and accurate billings
- Optimized resource allocation
- Informed Decision-making
