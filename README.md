## Swimlanes and Their Roles

### 1. Guest 
Acts as the primary user of hotel services, initiating the reservation process, checking in, enjoying the amenities, and completing payment at check-out.
### 2. Front Desk
Oversees key operational tasks, including managing room availability, confirming reservations, checking in guests, assigning rooms, updating bills for any additional charges, and ensuring a smooth check-out process.
### 3. Housekeeping
Plays a vital role in guest satisfaction by preparing rooms for check-in, performing regular cleaning during the stay, and responding to specific cleaning requests.
### 4. Billing
Ensures accurate financial transactions by creating and maintaining billing records, generating the final invoice, and processing payments efficiently during check-out.
In a well-coordinated hospitality system, these roles work in tandem to deliver a seamless experience for guests while maintaining operational efficiency.

## Step-by-Step Flow Description with Decision Point
### 1. Guest Makes a Reservation
The journey begins when a guest submits a reservation request, either online or in person. At this stage, key details such as room type, check-in and check-out dates, and any special preferences are collected.
If the requested room is available, the reservation is confirmed, and the guest receives a confirmation message. In case the room is unavailable, alternative options are presented to the guest, such as adjusting the stay dates or selecting a different room type.
This step sets the foundation for the guest's overall experience, making accuracy and responsiveness crucial.
